* Question 1: The histograms are good, but your interpretation is just a statement of how histograms work. Need to say more about what these tell you.<p>
* Question 2: The color schemes are messed up for every map besides rain and mintemp. They aren't the names of colorbrewer schemes. So you get just a single color, not an actual color scheme.<p>
* Question 3: This can work<p>
* Question 4: You do an OK job on this, but you could say more about the magnitude of all coefficients. You only really do so with temperature.<p>
* Question 5: good<p>
* Question 6: This is confusing to follow, particularly the parentheticals listing the beta coefficients. They're listed 2 or 3 times? Think about how to interpret them in the units relevant to each variable (degrees, mm, etc.)<p>
* Question 7: Good<p>
* Question 8: I hadn't used `sandwich` before. Interesting. <p>
* Question 9: Good<p>
* Challenge: You're close on this! Similar to Q1, you interpret the idea of the model but not the actual results. You need to have that.<p>

General feedback: There's some revision to do here, so it is incomplete. Main issues are in Q1, Q2, Q6, and the challenge question.
